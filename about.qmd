Hi, I'm Yasmine El-Kattan and welcome to my website! I am a Procurement Analyst at Wayfair and a candidate for my Master's in Business Analytics from Boston University. I learned how to make my own website in my Web Analytics class in Spring 2025. This has become my hub to showcase my work and further my technical skills. Outside of my work and school life I enjoy reading, working out, baking, and painting my nails.


Personal Background
- palestinian american

Professional Background
- studied ie it's the best
- interned at pepsi
- during covid realized i found supply chain interesting
- work at wayfair switched from customs to procurement analyst (ocean containers are super interesting and never ending)
- went back to school to further my understanding of analytics to see how i can merge it with my job even more

Hobbies and how I got into them
- reading
- nails
- working out
- baking
