Hi, I'm Yasmine El-Kattan and welcome to my website! I am a Procurement Analyst at Wayfair and a candidate for my Masters in Business Analytics from Boston University. I learned how to make my own website in my Web Analytics class in Spring 2025. This has become my hub to showcase my work and further my technical skills. Outside of my work and school life I enjoy reading, working out, baking, and painting my nails.


## Professional Background
I graduated from University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2022 with a Bachelors in Industrial Engineering with a focus in Supply Chain Logistics. I was initially exposed to Industrial Engineering by my mom when she was working on her PhD in Industrial Engineering, when it came time to choose a major I couldn't see myself pursuing anything else. During the COVID-19 pandemic while choosing which track to follow, I increasingly became fascinated by supply chain and its impact on the world. Naturally, it became the track I wanted to follow and was able to gain exposure to it through an internship at PepsiCo the following summer. My experience there was fascinating while getting exposure to quality control, manufacturing, production, and logistics. From there I pursued a career in operations analytics at Wayfair in their in-house freight-forwarder - Castlegate Forwarding. I began my career in Import Customs and have since pivoted to Ocean Procurement, Contracts & Compliance, and Import Customs. I have built out the analytics for the Import Customs team and have been chipping away at the analytics for Ocean Procurement and Contracts & Compliance since September of 2024. I began pursuing my Masters in Fall 2023 to find a way to bridge my understanding of supply chain logistics with business analytics at Metropolitan College in Boston University. My time at BU has been so fruitful as I deepened my understanding of analytics and strengthened my SQL, Python, and R skills.

## My Hobbies
Outside of work and school my hobbies include baking, nail art, reading, and working out. My field of work is incredibly fast paced and the beauty in these hobbies is I'm forced to focus on what is in front of me. Below are some pictures of items I have baked and some nail art I have done.
