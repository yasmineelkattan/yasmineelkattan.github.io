**Lobster Land Project (MET AD654)** [May â€“ June 2024]{.cvdate}

This was a graduate school group project designed to curate the optimal lineup of 1980s movies for a special event. This was accomplished by conducting comprehensive exploratory data analysis using Python and Tableau. We meticulously cleaned the dataset and created clear, insightful visualizations in Tableau, helping us extract valuable insights. Further in Python, we ran detailed summary statistics to uncover key trends and essential information within our dataset. The team utilized customer segmentation, conjoint analysis, and A/B testing for decisions made. Finally, we synthesized our findings into practical, data-driven recommendations, ensuring our project provided meaningful, actionable insights for the successful execution of the event.
