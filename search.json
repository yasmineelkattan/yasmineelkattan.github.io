    "text": "Lobster Land Project (MET AD654) May – June 2024\nThis was a graduate school group project designed to curate the optimal lineup of 1980s movies for a special event. This was accomplished by conducting comprehensive exploratory data analysis using Python and Tableau. We meticulously cleaned the dataset and created clear, insightful visualizations in Tableau, helping us extract valuable insights. Further in Python, we ran detailed summary statistics to uncover key trends and essential information within our dataset. The team utilized customer segmentation, conjoint analysis, and A/B testing for decisions made. Finally, we synthesized our findings into practical, data-driven recommendations, ensuring our project provided meaningful, actionable insights for the successful execution of the event. Check it out here! Check it out here!\nSenior Capstone Project September 2021 - May 2022\nFor my Industrial Engineering Senior Capstone Project, I was responsible for concept development and guiding analytical strategies. Our team collaborated with Raytheon to evaluate multiple softwares to balloon parts of spec parts manufactured by suppliers to decrease costs on behalf of Raytheon. We conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis using R and creating cost-benefit analyses to rank and recommend the best softwares for Raytheon’s quality control. Check it out here!"

    "section": "Professional Background",
    "text": "Professional Background\nI graduated from University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2022 with a Bachelors in Industrial Engineering with a focus in Supply Chain Logistics. I was initially exposed to Industrial Engineering by my mom when she was working on her PhD in Industrial Engineering, when it came time to choose a major I couldn’t see myself pursuing anything else. During the COVID-19 pandemic while choosing which track to follow, I increasingly became fascinated by supply chain and its impact on the world. Naturally, it became the track I wanted to follow and was able to gain exposure to it through an internship at PepsiCo the following summer. My experience there was fascinating while getting exposure to quality control, manufacturing, production, and logistics. From there I pursued a career in operations analytics at Wayfair in their in-house freight-forwarder - Castlegate Forwarding. I began my career in Import Customs and have since pivoted to Ocean Procurement, Contracts & Compliance, and Import Customs. I have built out the analytics for the Import Customs team and have been chipping away at the analytics for Ocean Procurement and Contracts & Compliance since September of 2024. I began pursuing my Masters in Fall 2023 to find a way to bridge my understanding of supply chain logistics with business analytics at Metropolitan College in Boston University. My time at BU has been so fruitful as I deepened my understanding of analytics and strengthened my SQL, Python, and R skills."
